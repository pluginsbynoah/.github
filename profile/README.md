# Noah's Plugins
Welcome to my library of plugins, mostly for neovim and emacs.
## Why the organisation?
Using these plugins often requires a github link to the repo,
which means that changing your username would break people's configs.
Placing my plugins in this organisation means I can change my username whenever,
and keep people happy
